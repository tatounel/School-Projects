Assignment 3 - Due 11/05/18 11:59:59pm

Part 1 - Preparing an online portfolio
The next part of the assignment uses Github to submit the assignment. If you don’t have a Github account yet, create one.
These links might be helpful:
https://help.github.com/categories/setup/
https://education.github.com/ 
Once you have that account created, within your account create a new repo following the structure username.github.io - this is the bases for producing a website hosted by github pages (https://pages.github.com/). We’ll fill this in later.
Further information on setting up github pages can be found on their website https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/ 
If set up properly you should be able to access your website from http://username.github.io
Part 2 - Word Frequencies
Get the lyrics to one of your favorite songs and using a hashmap (or similar data structure), count the number of times words appear in the song. By doing this you will be able to convert song lyrics to list of frequencies.
You can copy the songs from a website such as https://genius.com/ into a text file.
Read this text file from your code.
Count the appearance of each unique word in the lyrics.
Share the output of the results.
Example:
100: frog
94: dog
43: cog
20: bog
Part 3 - Word Cloud
Using the Kumo library you can convert the word frequencies to a word cloud.

Examples of word clouds can be found at the link above.
The submission of this part would involve uploading to your github pages repo such that it can be viewed from a web page.
Part 4 - Upload to Website
You’ll be uploading the image to a simple static website hosted under your github account. More instructions will be given later this week.

Example Web Site: http://datamascara.github.io/cisc3130-assignment3/ 
Note that when you use github pages, you can access your website at http://username.github.io and the underlying files would be found at http://github.com/username/username.github.io
