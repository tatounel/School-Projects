Been sick with the pen since I was ten inches tall
I'm relentless you guessed it back with the vengeance
In the set list every sentence so raw you can sense it
No question tryna be the best that
Ever walked this earth if I'm not then I'm next up
Dressed up like I'm 'bout to hit a bank or somethin'
Yeah I am not the one you wanna mess with, no
When I come into the room put your heads down
I'm a little bit TÃ˜P Stressed Out
What does that mean
I'm a rap fiend with a bad lead
You could run if you want but you'll never catch me
So cold with it y'all don't get it
Let you put me in a cage just so I can open it
Handcuffed hands up this is dope to me
Oh you thought you had me captured So funny
Better run from me I don't think you really understand what this does for me
I dress bummy but I clean up nice they ain't never seen this side of me
Long T-shirt they eyein' me
Rules don't apply to me
You better give me my privacy
I got the fans I got because I'm takin' them behind the scenes
You played hide-and-seek I played hide-from-me agh
Yeah  look at all that we accomplished
Quittin' for me's not an option
I wanna look at my kids in the face when I'm older and say I did something admirable
Fast checks fast women that don't inspire me no
You don't wanna know what's goin' on inside my personal life Then get out my diary yeah
 

I wanna know what it's like to be happy
I wanna know what it's like to wake up in the morning and feel like it's real when I'm laughin' yeah
I wanna know what it's like to sit down with my friends and feel like they might understand me woo
I wanna know that the people around me care less about Grammys and more about family

I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know Yeah yeah
I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know I wanna know Yeah I wanna know
I wanna know I wanna know
